# Welcome to Projects of DiffEngine

In this folder, we welcome all contribution of diffusion model training from community.

Here, these requirements, e.g. code standards, are not that strict as in core package. Thus, developers from the community can implement their algorithms much more easily and efficiently in DiffEngine. We appreciate all contributions from community to make DiffEngine greater.

Here is an [example project](./face_expression/) about how to add your algorithms easily.

We also provide some documentation listed below:
